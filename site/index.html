          <p>
            After devoting a decade of my career to improving healthcare and patient outcomes, I left my last job at
            <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank">The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a> in
            Cambridge, MA to start product coaching full-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been fortunate enough to be mentored by amazing product leaders and coaches, and saw
            the
            difference it made to both my professional and personal life. I wanted to pay it forward, and began
            coaching
            product managers during my spare time. It was hard work, but hearing how much my coaching meant to those
            first clients made it all worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a mother with a young child, I am more mindful than ever about how I spend my time and what example I
            set. I decided to take a leap of faith to pursue this dream and spend more time doing what I enjoy the
            most&mdash;helping and empowering others.
